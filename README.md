<h2>Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
<p>If you encounter any issues while running this project, here are a few things you can try:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have the latest version of all required software (see the "Prerequisites" section above)</li>
  <li>Double-check that you have correctly entered the command line arguments</li>
  <li>Ensure that the key file, message file, and password are in the correct format and meet the requirements (see the "FAQ" section below for more information)</li>
  <li>Try running the program with different values for the number of rounds (if specified in the command line)</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>Here are some frequently asked questions about this project:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>What is the format of the key file?</dt>
  <dd>The key file should contain a single line with a series of hexadecimal values separated by spaces. The number of values should be a multiple of 8.</dd>
  <dt>What is the format of the message file?</dt>
 <dd>The message file can be any data format (.mp3, .jpg, .txt, etc). Sample test files in multiple formats are located in the root of the project directory:</dd>
  <ul>
    <li>ThoseWithTime.png</li>
    <li>Truth.mp3</li>
    <li>Frustration.gif</li>
    <li>AfterDebugging.jpg</li>
    <li>ATest.txt</li>
  </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>What is the format of the password?</dt>
  <dd>The password should be a single line with a series of ASCII characters. The number of characters should be between 8 and 32, inclusive.</dd>
